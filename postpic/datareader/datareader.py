class Dumpreader_ifc(with_metaclass(abc.ABCMeta, FieldAnalyzer)):
    '''
    Interface class for reading a single dump. A dump contains informations
    about the  simulation at a single timestep (Usually E- and B-Fields on
    grid + particles).

    Any Dumpreader_ifc implementation will always be initialized using a
    dumpidentifier. This dumpidentifier can be anything, that points to
    the data of a dump. In the easiest case this is just the filename of
    the dump holding all data of that timestep
    (for example .sdf file for EPOCH, .hdf5 for some other code).

    The dumpreader should provide all necessary informations in a unified interface
    but at the same time it should not restrict the user to these properties of there
    dump only. The recommended implementation is shown here (EPOCH and VSim reader
    work like this):
    All (!) data, that is saved in a single dump should be accessible via the
    self.__getitem__(key) method. Together with the self.keys() method, this will ensure,
    that every dumpreader works as a dictionary and every dump attribute is accessible
    via this dictionary.

    Hirachy of methods
    ------------------
    * Level 0:
    __getitem__ and keys(self) are level 0 methods, meaning it must be possible to access
    everthing with those methods.

    * Level 1:
    provide direct data access by forwarding the requests to the corresponding Level 0
    or Level 1 methods.

    * Level 2:
    provide user access to the data by forwarding the request to Level 1 or Level 2 methods,
    but NOT to Level 0 methods.

    If some attribute wasnt dumped a KeyError must be thrown. This allows
    classes which are using the reader to just exit if a needed property wasnt dumped
    or to catch the KeyError and proceed by actively ignoring it.

    It is highly recommended to also override the functions __str__ and gridpoints.

    Args:
      dumpidentifier : variable type
        whatever identifies the dump. It is recommended to use a String
        here pointing to a file.
