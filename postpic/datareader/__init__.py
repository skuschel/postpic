'''
The Datareader package contains methods and interfaces to read data from
any Simulation.

The basic concept consits of two different types of readers:

The Dumpreader
--------------
This has to be subclassed from Dumpreader_ifc and allows to read a single dump
created by the simulation. To identify which dump should be read its
initialized with a dumpidentifier. This dumpidentifier can be almost anything,
but in the easiest case this is the filepath pointing to a single file
containing every information about this simulation dump. With this information
the dumpreader must be able to read all data regarding this dump (which is a
lot: X, Y, Z, Px, Py, Py, weight, mass, charge, ID,.. for all particle species,
electric and magnetic fields on grid, the grid itself, mabe particle ids,...)

The Simulationreader
--------------------
This has to be subclassed from Simulationreader_ifc and allows to read a full
list of simulation dumps. Thus an alternate Name for this class could be
"Dumpsequence". This allows the code to track particles from different times
of the simulation or create plots with a time axis.

def readDump(dumpidentifier, **kwargs):
    '''
    After using the fucntion :func:`postpic.chooseCode`, this function should
    be the main function for reading a dump into postpic.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dumpidentifier : str
        Identifies the dump. For most dumpreaders this is a string
        poining to the file or folder. See what the specific
        reader of your format expects.
    **kwargs
        will be forwarded to the dumpreader.

    Returns
    -------
    Dumpreader
        the dumpreader for this specific data dump.

def readSim(simidentifier, **kwargs):
    '''
    After using the function :func:`postpic.chooseCode`, this function should
    be the main function for reading a simulation into postpic.
    A simulation is equivalent to a series of dumps in a specific order
    (not neccessarily time order).

    Args:
        simidentifier (str): Identifies the simulation.
            For EPOCH this should be a string pointing to a `.visit` file.
            Specifics depend on the current simreader class,
            as set by `chooseCode`.
        **kwargs: will be forwarded to the simreader.

    Returns:
        the Simulationreader

    Chooses appropriate reader for the given simulation code.
    After choosing a preset of the correct reader, the functions
    :func:`postpic.readDump` and :func:`postpic.readSim` are setup for this preset.
